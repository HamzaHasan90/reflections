-What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
 commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?



    in Git : it makes it easier for me to choose the version that I need to save for a quick references later on.
    in Google docs : it might get me some troubles whenever I need to to quickly refer to a certain version of my file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?




    Of course it is way better an managable to have the ability to commit mutiple files at the same time.
